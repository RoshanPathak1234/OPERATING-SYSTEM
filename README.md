# Operating System Problem Solvers

This project provides solutions for a variety of classic operating system problems including **CPU scheduling**, **disk scheduling**, and **synchronization problems**. It offers a modular structure for implementing various algorithms in these domains. Each algorithm is implemented as a separate class and can be accessed either via a **command-line interface (CLI)** or **REST API**.

## Project Overview

This project solves some of the most important problems in an operating system:

- **CPU Scheduling**: Algorithms like **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**, **Shortest Job First (SJF)**, **Priority Scheduling**, **Round Robin**.
- **Disk Scheduling**: Algorithms like **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**, **Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)**, **SCAN**.
- **Synchronization**: Problems like **Mutex**, **Semaphore**, **Producer-Consumer**, **Deadlock Detection**.

Each of these problems is implemented in a modular way, and you can easily extend or replace algorithms by implementing the relevant interfaces. The project also includes exception handling to ensure smooth operation during execution.

## Features

- **Modular Structure**: Each problem domain is organized into separate modules for CPU scheduling, disk scheduling, and synchronization.
- **Extensible Algorithms**: Add or replace algorithms by implementing common interfaces (`Strategy`, `SchedulingAlgorithm`, etc.).
- **Exception Handling**: Custom exceptions and handlers for dealing with invalid input and runtime issues.
- **CLI and API Support**: The project supports both **command-line** and **REST API** usage.
- **Cross-platform**: The code is platform-independent and works on any operating system (Linux, macOS, Windows).

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The core programming language for implementing the algorithms and business logic.
- **JUnit**: For writing unit tests to ensure the correctness of each algorithm.
- **Spring Boot** (optional): If you wish to expose the algorithms via a **REST API**.
- **Maven**: For managing project dependencies and building the project.

## Usage

### CLI Usage

To use the **CLI** version of the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd yourproject
   ```

3. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   javac -d bin src/main/*.java
   ```

4. Run the program (Example: to execute a CPU scheduling algorithm):
   ```bash
   java -cp bin main.Main
   ```

5. To execute specific scheduling strategies (e.g., FCFS, SJF), instantiate the appropriate strategy in `Main.java`.

### API Usage

To expose your algorithms via a **REST API** (optional), you can use **Spring Boot** or any other Java-based framework. Below is an example using Spring Boot:

1. Start the Spring Boot application by running the `main` class:
   ```bash
   java -cp bin main.Main
   ```

2. Access the scheduling algorithms via HTTP requests:
   - **GET** `/api/scheduling/cpu`
   - **GET** `/api/scheduling/disk`
   - **POST** `/api/scheduling/cpu/execute`
   - **POST** `/api/synchronization/deadlock`
   
   Refer to the `SchedulingController` or `SynchronizationController` classes to see specific endpoints for each algorithm.

### Example API Request
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/scheduling/cpu/execute -d '{"pid":[1,2,3],"arrivalTime":[0,1,2],"burstTime":[4,5,6],"contextSwitchingDelay":1}'
```

### Testing

1. The project uses **JUnit** for unit testing. To run tests:
   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

2. Test cases for each scheduling and synchronization algorithm are provided in the `/tests` folder.

## UML Diagram

Here is a high-level **UML diagram** that shows the structure of the main classes involved in the CPU Scheduling problem:

```
+-------------------+     +-----------------+     +-------------------+
|    CpuScheduling  |<>---|    Process      |     |   Strategy        |
+-------------------+     +-----------------+     +-------------------+
| - pid: List<Integer>   |     | - pid: int      |     | + execute(process[])|
| - arrivalTime: List<Integer> | | - burstTime: int |     +-------------------+
| - burstTime: List<Integer> |   | - arrivalTime: int |
| - priority: List<Integer> |   | - completionTime: int |
| - contextSwitchingDelay: int | | - waitingTime: int  |
+-------------------+     +-----------------+     +-------------------+
        ^                        ^                       ^
        |                        |                       |
        |                        |                       |
+------------------+   +------------------+       +-------------------+
|   FCFSStrategy   |   |  SJFStrategy     |       | RoundRobinStrategy |
+------------------+   +------------------+       +-------------------+
| + execute(process[])|   | + execute(process[]) |       | + execute(process[]) |
+------------------+   +------------------+       +-------------------+
```

- **CpuScheduling** manages the entire scheduling process, including setting up the scheduling strategy, handling the input data, and printing the results.
- **Process** represents individual processes with details such as process ID (PID), burst time, arrival time, and calculated times.
- **Strategy** is an interface for different scheduling algorithms such as **FCFS**, **SJF**, and **Round Robin**.

## Future Scope

While this project already solves various operating system problems, there are several potential improvements and extensions for the future:

1. **Preemptive Algorithms**: Extend support to preemptive scheduling algorithms such as **Preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF)**, **Preemptive Priority Scheduling**, and **Preemptive Round Robin**.
2. **Real-time Scheduling**: Implement real-time scheduling algorithms such as **Earliest Deadline First (EDF)** and **Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS)**.
3. **Advanced Disk Scheduling**: Implement more advanced disk scheduling algorithms such as **LOOK**, **C-LOOK**, and **Circular SCAN**.
4. **Multi-core Scheduling**: Extend the CPU scheduling algorithms to work for multi-core processors.
5. **Integration with Operating System**: Consider integrating this project with an actual operating system kernel for hands-on learning or use.

## Applications

The algorithms and solutions provided by this project can be applied to several real-world scenarios:

1. **CPU Scheduling**:
   - **Multitasking Operating Systems**: Scheduling multiple processes for execution in a fair and efficient manner.
   - **Embedded Systems**: Time-sharing and priority-based scheduling in embedded systems with limited resources.
   
2. **Disk Scheduling**:
   - **Hard Disk Drive

 (HDD)**: Scheduling disk access requests to minimize seek time and improve performance.
   - **Cloud Storage Systems**: Efficient data retrieval by scheduling disk I/O operations.

3. **Synchronization**:
   - **Concurrency Management**: Ensuring multiple threads or processes work together without causing race conditions or deadlocks.
   - **Database Management Systems (DBMS)**: Handling multiple users or processes accessing shared data concurrently.
