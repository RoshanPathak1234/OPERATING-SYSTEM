# CPU Scheduling Algorithms

This project provides a flexible framework to simulate and analyze various **CPU scheduling algorithms**. It implements popular scheduling strategies like **FCFS (First-Come, First-Serve)**, **SJF (Shortest Job First)**, and more. The design is modular, allowing for easy addition of new algorithms.

## Project Structure

### **Classes Overview**

1. **`CpuScheduling`**:
   - Manages process information (PID, Arrival Time, Burst Time, etc.).
   - Executes scheduling strategies using the `Strategy` interface.
   - Provides utility methods like average turnaround time, waiting time, efficiency, and throughput.

2. **`Strategy` (Interface)**:
   - Abstracts scheduling algorithms.
   - Methods to implement:
     ```java
     void execute(
         ArrayList<Integer> Pid,
         ArrayList<Integer> AT,
         ArrayList<Integer> BT,
         ArrayList<Integer> CT,
         ArrayList<Integer> TAT,
         ArrayList<Integer> WT,
         int CSD
     );
     ```

3. **Scheduling Algorithm Classes (e.g., `FCFS`, `SJF`)**:
   - Each class implements the `Strategy` interface.
   - Encapsulates the logic for a specific scheduling algorithm.

4. **`Main`**:
   - Handles user interaction.
   - Captures process data from the user and executes selected scheduling algorithms.
   - Displays results such as **Completion Time**, **Turnaround Time**, **Waiting Time**, etc.

## How to Use

### 1. **Run the Application**
   - Compile and run the `Main` class.
   - Use any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or run via the command line:
     ```bash
     javac Main.java
     java Main
     ```

### 2. **Input Format**
   - Enter the number of processes.
   - Input the **Arrival Time (AT)** and **Burst Time (BT)** for each process.

### 3. **Output**
   - Displays results for each algorithm:
     - Completion Time (CT)
     - Turnaround Time (TAT)
     - Waiting Time (WT)
     - Average TAT and WT
     - CPU Efficiency and Throughput.

### 4. **Adding a New Algorithm**
   - Implement the `Strategy` interface.
   - Define the logic in the `execute()` method.
   - Register the new strategy in the `Main` class for user selection.
